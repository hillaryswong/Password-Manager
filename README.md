# Password-Manager

## Description
- This is a CLI application that is intended to store one's passwords. The specific entry fields needed are the name of the organization in which one's account is created with, the username, and the password. 
- I primarily created this program because I wanted to practice implementing a data structure that I had learned about in class but did not have the chance to practice implenting in an assignment which is a linked list. There was no specific reason why I chose this data structure instead of other ones that I had learned about aside from the fact that I had not used it before.
- I did not implement any encryption or any authentication measures yet. However, those are two features that I plan to incorporate at a later time.
